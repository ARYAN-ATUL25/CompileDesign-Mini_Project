# Intermediate Code Generator
An intermediate code generator is a crucial component of a compiler that helps in the conversion of high-level programming languages into machine code. The process involves several stages, including lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, code optimization, and code generation.

# Goal of the project
The goal of the intermediate code generator is to create an intermediate representation of the source code that can be easily translated into machine code. The intermediate representation is machine-independent, which means that it can be easily translated into machine code for different target platforms.

# Working
The intermediate code generator works by taking the output from the syntax analysis stage, which is a parse tree or an abstract syntax tree (AST), and transforming it into an intermediate code representation. This intermediate code is then optimized and translated into machine code by the code generator.
There are several advantages to using an intermediate code generator. Firstly, it simplifies the process of creating machine code for different platforms. Secondly, it allows for code optimization, which can result in faster and more efficient code. Lastly, it enables easier debugging, as the intermediate code is machine-independent and can be easily analyzed.
